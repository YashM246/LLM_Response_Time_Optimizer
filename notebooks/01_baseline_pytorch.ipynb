      "Output: Explain quantum computing in simple terms. Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum bits, or qubits, instead of classical bits to process information. Qubits can exist in multiple states at once, allowing quantum computers to perform many calculations simultaneously. This property, known as superposition, enables quantum computers to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers. Additionally, quantum computers can also use a phenomenon called entanglement, where qubits become interconnected and their states influence each other, even when separated by large distances. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations that are impossible for classical computers. Overall, quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, optimization, and materials science, but it is still a complex and developing technology.\n",
